# zk-sync-era-erc20-token-bridge
🌁
unofficial experimental bridge for deposit and withdraw of regular erc20 tokens on ZK Sync Era mainnet or testnet

## How to run this:
Run locally. I used vscode and already had npm installed.
use `npm ci`, `npm run dev` to create local svelte app. Make changes in settings file such as adding a private key.

Possible future improvements: 
* move sections into svelte components
* add metamask confirmations on zk sync interactions
